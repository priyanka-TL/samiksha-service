    This API collection serves the Survey Service, covering both Observations and Surveys. It provides various endpoints for managing and interacting with surveys and observations, along with comprehensive report generation functionalities.

    Observations:
    Observations with Rubric: Allows assessment based on predefined rubrics.
    Observations without Rubric: Flexible observations without structured rubrics.
    Reports:
    Survey Reports: Generate detailed reports based on survey submissions.
    Observation Reports: Includes:
    Entity Reports: Focuses on specific entities being observed.
    Instance Reports: Provides detailed information on specific instances of observation.
    PDF Reports: Available for both entity and instance reports.
    This API collection supports essential workflows such as criteria upload, observation submission, report generation, and program management. It simplifies the process of collecting, managing, and analyzing data for both surveys and observations.

         The Upload Framework API allows users to upload a CSV file containing observation data, along with a framework in JSON format. The framework sheet should include an external_id (UUID) for each framework entry, and the criteria external_id generated during the criteria upload process must also be included.

        This API is used to create solutions based on a framework upload. Users must provide a frameworkID (UUID) and specify the entityType as defined in the template.

The programId should be passed in the query parameters (req.query.programId), which represents the external ID of the program. Once mapped, the solution will be associated with the designated program, allowing for its usage within the context of that program.
